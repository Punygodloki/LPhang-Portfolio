                <br>
        
                <p> My main goal is to gain experience as well as to enhance professional skills, capabilities and knowledge in an organization which recognizes the value of hard work and trusts me with responsibilities and challenges. For this purpose, is what led me to pursue further experience outside of what I doing in University. I hope to get a stand into a field in which I am most interested in whether it be Graphic Design or Software Development/Programming. <br><br> Most of my works were done as a hobby to challenge myself and see how much more I can improve with each one and for this getting into a environment that can help me grow is what I believe would be the push that I need.</p>
